TODO
	- Right now, fields are responsible for reporting back their database representation.  That's not ideal.  Each DB should have a table
	of representations to use for each field type.  All fields could then report their data purely as strings and let the DB wrapper
	handle reconverting to a valid data type.

	- Filters need some work.  Much like [1], the value in example__exact=value must contain user defined quotes
	when the field is a text type.  The database should look this up and convert as needed.  Maybe the DB needs
	to store a copy of each model type loaded that it can "glance" at when it needs to know field types

	- Make filters in to classes

	- Remove unnecessary direct attribute calls when dealing with models and fields.  Add proper properties or methods.
