Puck
=========

Puck is a semi-automatic object-relational mapping (ORM) framework for multisource data tracking.
The intent is to provide a wrapping framework for data source from multiple locations, e.g.
html, local, ftp, sftp, Amazon, Dropbox, http.

Only the object-relational model is currently in place.  This framework intetionally bears 
a *small* resemblance to Django.  While I enjoy the power and flexibility of Django
I have many small projects that could benefit from a lite-ORM.  Eventually the ORM will 
become a standalone module.
